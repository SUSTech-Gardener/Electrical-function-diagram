# Introduction
 With the development of science and technology and
social progress, agriculture has ushered in the digital
information age. Our country has initially established
a new agricultural system of automatic farming and
information management. The future agriculture must
be an important foothold of robot automation industry,
the use of automation technology can greatly improve the
efficiency of farming and reduce labor costs, and solve
the contradiction of labor shortage. Precision agriculture
is an important part of agricultural automation. It
implements more appropriate planting and maintenance
methods for different cultivated crops, so as to improve
the planting quality and market competitiveness of
agricultural products.<br>
